	<h1>Devhelp Documentation</h1>
	<p>The Library Hover Devhelp plug-in supplies hover help for library API documentation available in Devhelp format.
		The plug-in also makes Devhelp documentation browsable and searchable in the Eclipse help system.</p>
	<p>Library Hover Devhelp works with the documentation generators used most commonly by the GNOME project libraries.
		Other kinds of libraries can be supported as well, as long as the API documentation is available in HTML and a
		<strong>*.devhelp2</strong> index file is present.</p>
	<p>The documentation must be installed locally, so an internet connection is not needed to use Library Hover
		Devhelp.</p>
